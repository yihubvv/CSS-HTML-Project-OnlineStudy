CSS-HTML-Project — OnlineStudy

This repository contains a single-page static site that presents a polished course catalog and marketing banner for an e-learning product. 

The page is intentionally non-interactive — it focuses on layout, typography, imagery, and hover states to showcase front-end design and CSS skills.
